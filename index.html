                            This is my about me section:
                            Tyna William is a software engineer bla bla who obviously enjoys
                            speaking about herself in the third person.
                            Fun Fact: I started my college career as a dual major in biochemistry
                            and molecular biology. Whilst I've always loved the sciences, what I didn't love
                            is the lack of room for creative expression during an undergrad career.
                            I wanted to do something where I could see the products of my hard work manifest
                            in front of me ... enter computer science. From my first "hello world" program, I
                            fell in love with the creativity computer science afforded me. I became a CS major and
                            never looked back.
                            After college, I decided I wanted to feel more "work ready" before I could call myself
                            a software engineer, and so I went on to pursue a software engineering track with App Academy.
                            Now here we are!
